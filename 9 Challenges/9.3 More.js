Mario (More)

It is recommended that you finish Mario (Less) before moving onto this challenge.

In this challenge we will also recreate pyramids from the video game mario. 
If you have ever played that game, you might have noticed two pyramids facing each other. 
In this challenge we will have to recreate those pyramids. For example:

    #  #
   ##  ##
  ###  ###
 ####  ####
#####  #####
These pyramids have a height of 5. The height will be anywhere from 1 to 8. 
You are given the height of these pyramids in the program. 
Your job is to use the height to print these two pyramids facing away from each other with 2 spaces in 
between. Remember, every time you print in JavaScript, you transfer to a new line. 
To avoid that, you should create a string with spaces and dashes of the row and then print the string.


Challenge

Hard
You are given a function called pyramids that takes in a parameter called height. 
You need to complete the code inside the function to make it print pyramids as shown above. 
A pyramid of height 3 would look like:

  #  #
 ##  ##
###  ###

Hints
Your code should work the same as the code for Mario (Less), 
just after the spaces and dashes for the first pyramid, you need to add two spaces 
to the string, and then i dashes again. If you have not done Mario (Less) yet, please 
do so before you continue.
