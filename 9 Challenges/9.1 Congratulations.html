Test your skills!

Congratulations!
You made it through the hard part of the course. 
You finished all lessons. Now, it is time to put some of your knowledge to the test!

In the upcoming lessons you will try to solve some challenges 
that might not be as easy as you are used to.

Before we move on, I just want to say that you learned a lot in this course. 
It is a fairly big course with a lot of information. You might feel a bit discouraged if you f
orget some of the things you learn, but you should not feel like that at all. Do you know why every 
programmer jokes that most of programming is just using google? Because it's true! The key to being a 
good programmer isn't knowing every concept, it's knowing every concept that exists! For example, you 
don't need to know every method in the Math object. You just need to know that the Math object exists 
in JavaScript. After that, every time you need to use it, you can look at the documentation or just 
google about the Math object and use it however you want! So, next time you forget how many parameters 
a built-in function in JavaScript takes in, don't feel bad, because even professionals forget a lot. 
Just google it!
