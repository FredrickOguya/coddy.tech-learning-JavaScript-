Hello World!

In the programming world, once a new apprentice wants to learn the magic of code, they are introduced with a program called "Hello, World!". This is one of the most simple programs you can write with any language.

The program consists of printing "Hello, World!" to the screen. In JavaScript, we can print words, numbers and data with the command console.log().

For example, if we want to print "Hello, World!" we would write:

console.log('Hello, World!');
When we want to print text, we have to write the text in the parentheses of console.log(). We also have to wrap the text with ' ' or " " so the compiler that runs the program knows that the text we wrote isn't code, but actual text we want to print.


Challenge

Easy
Now, it's your turn. Write the command and press "Run Code". Remember, the program has to print EXACTLY "Hello, World!" in order to be correct.

console.log('Hello, World!');
