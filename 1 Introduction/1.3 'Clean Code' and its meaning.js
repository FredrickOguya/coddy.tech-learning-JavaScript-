/*
Imagine you are a professional developer in a team of 15 developers. You are all working on one website. 
What would happen if every developer started writing code with their own principles and in their own 
distinct way? Chaos, of course! That's why it's important not just to write code, but to write clean code.

Clean code is code that is easy to read and understand. Any developer should be able to look at your code, 
read it, understand it easily and be able to continue it. As a beginner don't stress too much about this,
 but it's better to start early. During the course you will learn some principles that will help you make 
 sure your code is always clean. Believe it or not, you can already learn some principles:

 

Keep you code DRY
By DRY, we mean Don't Repeat Yourself. You will learn more about this later.

Use semicolons
In most programming languages, at the end of every line of code you have to put a semicolon ;. 
In JavaScript, it is not necessary to put a semicolon at the end of lines, but it is a good practice 
to put them. Some developers choose not to. Whatever you choose, stick to one and don't mix the two.
